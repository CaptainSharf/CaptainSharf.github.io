Hi! I'm a Senior year undergrad student at IIIT-H majoring in Computer Science.My interests lie in Virtual Reality(VR),Computational Photograhy and Deep Reinforcement Learning.

I am currently working at [ Dreamvu inc. ](http://dreamvu.com/) as a Research assistant.I have worked on generating real-time stereo panoramic videos and depth-maps from videos captured by a single-camera-mirror setup.A small demo of my work can be found [ here ](http://dreamvu.com/).I am now currently working on the problem of identifying objects and tracking them in the stereo-videos generated by our camera.I have worked on these projects in collaboration with [ Dr. Anoop Namboodiri ](http://dreamvu.com/) and [ Rajat Aggarwal ](http://dreamvu.com).

I'm also working as an undergraduate researcher at the Kohli Center for Intelligent Systems(IIIT-H) under the guidance of [ Dr.Girish Varma ](https://geevi.github.io).Our aim is to improve upon the peformance of the current visual servoying algorithms and come up with a better solution using Reinforcement Learning.Until now I have implemented many of  the fundamental algorithms in Deep-Reinforcement Learning including the [DQN](Atari140M Benchmark), [DDPG](Continuous)and the [A3C](on the Atari140M Benchmark) on environments in OpenAI-gym.

My Resume can be found here ([ CV ](https://web.iiit.ac.in/~mohammed.sharfuddin/images/Resume.pdf)).
